# IP-Adapter-FaceID test notebook

---

This is a sample notebook to test [IP-Adapter-FaceID](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID).  
This has been tested on Colab with a single T4.  

I find this approach faster and often more accurate than Dreambooth or LoRA if you only want a single human character to be featured in some generated images.
